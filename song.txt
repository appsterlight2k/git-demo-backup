sword and spear
wall of shields
some two more lines
of our song bla-bla-bla
add one line more for testing "git merge" command without previously executed the command "git fetch" 
the last one line in the song
there are two more lines
that I've added

So, this is a second verse
and we want to add it to master
when we commit the lyrics.
